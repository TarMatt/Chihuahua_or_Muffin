This project explores the application of machine learning in image classification. The goal was to develop and examine a classifier that could accurately distinguish between classes. For this purpose three neural network architectures have been considered. For each of them, the expected minimal risk has been estimated through a variation of the nested cross validation and, lastly, the resulting three best models have been commented.
